Trend Magic indicator for NinjaTrader 8

## Indicator
The Trend Magic indicator is an ATR-based trend line that uses CCI to control its upward and downward movement. It was once a popular indicator in the Forex trading world. When the CCI is greater than zero the line is only able to move upwards, and conversely, when the CCI is less than or equal to zero the line is only able to move downwards.

By default the line is colored based on the last direction it has moved. Enabling the CCI color mode will color the line based on if the CCI value is above or below zero.


## Installation Instructions
